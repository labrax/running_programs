# running_programs

This is a small python program to log your open windows and plot them.

You need to install Python. Python 3.8+ is suggested.

And then the following packages:
`seaborn`
`jupyter`
`numpy`
`pandas`

Be sure to have them installed and executable from a normal prompt.

Then, create a link to `run.bat` on your startup folder on the start menu.
It can be found on Windows Explorer going into: `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

To change the list of programs shown you'll need to edit `20210611_jupyter_plots.ipynb`.
